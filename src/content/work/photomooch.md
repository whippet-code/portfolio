### App Description

Built as a creative prompt provider, PhotoMooch is a mobile app that helps photographers find inspiration and connect with the mental well-being benefits of creativity. The app was designed and developed to run alongside the PhotoMooch collective, a group of four photographers who provide workshops and events to help people find their creative voice & discover the well-being benefits of photography. Built upon the React framework, the app is designed to be a simple, easy to use tool. With a MongoDB backend and a custom built api built with node.js, the app is designed to be scalable and easy to maintain.
Admin verification is required to access the admin side of the app, and once logged in, admin can edit, add and delete prompts from the database. The app is designed to be used by anyone, and is currently used by the PhotoMooch collective to provide creative prompts to their followers.
Users may use the app unregistered, but will not be able to access the save and mark as complete features.
Registered users can save prompts to their profile, and mark them as complete once they have completed the prompt. This allows users to keep track of their progress and revisit prompts they have completed in the past.

### Additional Information

An add on service has since been added utilising the OpenAI API to generate promnpts trained using current promnpts in the database. This allows the app to generate new prompts for users to use, and is currently being tested by the PhotoMooch collective.

A fun attempt at building a stock trading app with live API data. The app allows users to create an account, login, and trade stocks with live data. The app also allows users to view their transaction history and current portfolio value.
Built using Flask, Python, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The app uses the IEX API to fetch live stock data. Data is stored in a local SQLite database.

## Build Notes

Built using vanilla javascript, html and css. The app is hosted on firebase and uses a firebase database to store the data. The app is designed to be a simple, easy to use tool. With a firebase backend, the app is designed is then used via the browser but using a service worker, the app can be installed on a mobile device and used offline.
Currently used by myself and partner to keep track of our shopping list.
